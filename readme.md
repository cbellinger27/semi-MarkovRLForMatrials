The enclosed code corresponds to the paper:

Colin Bellinger, Rory Coles, Mark Crowley and Isaac Tamblyn, Reinforcement Learning in a Physics-Inspired Semi-Markov Environment, Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07333


The python scripts:

testDqn.py
testDqnHer.py
testDrqn.py
testDrqnHER.py

train and run the demos of DQN and DRQN with and without hindsight experience replay (HER) on the basic semi-Markov, discrete state and action phase change environment. 

The Python code requires the manual installation of:

Tensorflow
Keras
MatPlotLib
OpenAI gym

In addition, you will need to install the open phaseChangeEnvironment environment as per the instructions in the phaseChangeEnvironment folder. 

Please see https://github.com/CLEANit/ for related RL gyms and solutions.

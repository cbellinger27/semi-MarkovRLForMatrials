The python scripts:

testDqn.py
testDqnHer.py
testDrqn.py
testDrqnHER.py

train and run the demos of DQN and DRQN with and without hindsight experience replay (HER) on the basic semi-Markov, discrete state and action phase change environment. 

The Python code requires the manual installation of:

Tensorflow
Keras
MatPlotLib
OpenAI gym

In addition, you will need to install the open phaseChangeEnvironment environment as per the instructions in the phaseChangeEnvironment folder.
